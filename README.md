# 412-house-search

The 412 House Seach is an Pittsburgh based aggregator service aimed to create an enriched house search experience for incoming CMU students. Our service designed entirely in Python which makes it very nimble and fast, which means that you can now search for house of your choice without having to be overwhelmed by multiple rental websites and advertizements. You can now stop at 412-house-search.com as your one stop shop for all the rental solutions.


# Program Modules

Our service has been designed primarily using the Model-View-Controller(MVC) framework in Python enables us to keep our code clean and modular. In future extending support to multiple rental platforms is also easy.

1. Rental Computations

2. Display

3. Controller


# Next Steps

Our next step includes:

1. Creating microservice architecture

2. Feedback and recommendation system

3. Include non-conventional platofrms like Facebook and Airbnb in our aggregation.
